## Design Philosophy

### Stoic School Principles
1. **Education over judgment** - Inform, don't shame
2. **Action over awareness** - Provide clear next steps
3. **Philosophy over psychology** - Ancient wisdom + modern science
4. **Community over isolation** - We heal together
5. **Progress over perfection** - Small steps compound

### User-Centered Decisions
- **Why separate pages?** Users need context before assessment
- **Why time toggle?** Different people think differently (some in years, others in days)
- **Why philosophy?** Provides deeper "why" than statistics alone
- **Why Stoic School?** Positions as educational institution, not just app

### Technical Decisions
- **Why sessionStorage?** No backend yet, but preserves data during session
- **Why Framer Motion?** Smooth animations enhance emotional impact
- **Why Next.js App Router?** Modern, fast, great DX
- **Why TypeScript?** Type safety prevents bugs at scale
