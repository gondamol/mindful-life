**1. Twitter Launch Thread** 🐦

🧘‍♂️ I just launched Mindful Life - a PWA that shows you EXACTLY how much 
of your REMAINING life you'll spend on screens.

✅ Installs on your phone like a native app
✅ Works 100% offline
✅ Has achievements & streaks to keep you motivated
✅ 100% private - no tracking, no accounts

🧵 Thread on why I built this... (1/10)

---

[2/10] Inspired by Dino Ambrosi's TEDx talk, I calculated I'd spend 
115 MONTHS of my life scrolling. That's almost 10 YEARS.

That broke me.

---

[3/10] But most screen time apps just show you numbers. They don't:
• Make you feel the impact
• Help you stay consistent  
• Make it shareable
• Work offline

---

[4/10] So I built Mindful Life as a Progressive Web App:

📱 Installs to your home screen
⚡ Faster than native apps
📊 Beautiful visualizations
🎮 Gamification (10 achievements!)
🔥 Streak tracking
📤 Easy sharing

---

[5/10] Key features:

🎯 CALCULATOR: Shows your screen time in MONTHS, not hours
📊 DOT MATRIX: Visual representation of your remaining life  
🏆 ACHIEVEMENTS: Unlock badges for progress
🔥 STREAKS: Daily check-ins keep you accountable
📤 SHARING: Inspire friends to join

---

[6/10] What makes it special:

• NO login required
• NO data collection
• NO tracking
• 100% FREE forever
• Works completely OFFLINE
• Beautiful mobile-first design

Your data never leaves your device.

---

[7/10] The tech stack (for devs):

• Next.js 15 (Turbopack)
• TypeScript
• TailwindCSS 4
• Framer Motion
• PWA with service workers
• Local storage only

Open source coming soon! 🔓

---

[8/10] How to install:

Android: Chrome → Menu → "Add to Home screen"
iOS: Safari → Share → "Add to Home Screen"  
Desktop: Click install icon in address bar

Takes 10 seconds. Changes your life.

---

[9/10] What you'll get:

1️⃣ Shocking truth about your screen time
2️⃣ Visual wake-up call
3️⃣ Practical strategies to reduce usage
4️⃣ Daily motivation to stay on track
5️⃣ Community of people doing the same

a Progressive Web App that helps people understand their screen time 
impact through gamification and behavioral science.

🎯 THE SOLUTION:
A mobile-first PWA that:
• Calculates screen time in MONTHS (more impactful than hours)
• Uses dot matrix visualization (inspired by Wait But Why)
• Gamifies progress (10 achievements, streak tracking)
• Works 100% offline
• Requires zero login or data sharing

🛠️ TECH HIGHLIGHTS:
• Next.js 15 with Turbopack
• Service workers for offline functionality
• Local storage for privacy
• Framer Motion for smooth animations
• Mobile-first responsive design

🎯 EARLY RESULTS:
• < 1.5s load time
• 100/100 PWA Lighthouse score
• Installable on all platforms
• Zero data collection

💡 WHY IT MATTERS:
This isn't just about screen time - it's about helping people 
live more intentionally. Combined Stoic philosophy with modern UX.
