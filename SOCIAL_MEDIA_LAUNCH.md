🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Ubuntu Wisdom Academy

After watching Dino Ambrosi's TEDx talk about spending 5 years of his life on social media, I was inspired to build a solution that combines:

📊 Data-driven screen time calculations
🏛️ Ancient Stoic philosophy
🎓 Modern behavioral science
💌 Automated personalized action plans

**The Problem:**
Most of us have no idea how much of our REMAINING life we'll spend on screens. The numbers are shocking.

**The Solution:**
A platform that:
1. Shows you the raw truth (in months, not hours)
2. Delivers practical, actionable strategies
3. Teaches timeless wisdom from Marcus Aurelius & Seneca
4. Builds a community of intentional living

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js 15, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Resend, TypeScript

**Why I Built This:**
We're drowning in distractions. Ancient philosophers had solutions. Modern tech can deliver them at scale.
